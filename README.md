# Uninformed-Search-Algorithms
Some common algorithms apply it to images using opencv + QT.
- Breadth first search.
- Depth first search.
- Deepening depth first search.

Shows the path from point A to point B, with some little information. With obstacles.

# WARNING.
<b> There could be some nasty bugs, still in development. :) .Iterative deepening depth first search is not recomended to use (for now) because memory problems. Your RAM will be crazy, don't let it to go up to 90% .</b>
